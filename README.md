Full stack MERN application for bank app

This will eventually be a working banking application with splash login screen and dummy content. At some stage, I might connect this with a financial api.

# Currently implemented
* Full MERN app with code split by concerns
* Working JWT authenticated login in Express backend
* Login screen splash page
* Logged in account section
* Ability to create savings and current accounts with dummy data
* Ability to move money between accounts

# Planning to implement
* Interest growth on accounts running in background
* D3 charts to plot growth and account split
